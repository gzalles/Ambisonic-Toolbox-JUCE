# ambisonic-toolbox-JUCE
Collection of ambisonic plug-ins and apps developed with JUCE.

**quad-bin-dec:** uses speakers LF, LB, RB, FR along with the LISTEN (IRCAM) dataset.

All of these use ambix.

I developped these at UCSD during my studies under Tom Erbe. This was just an introduction to the JUCE framework. These plug-ins are not ready for use yet.
